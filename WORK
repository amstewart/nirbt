Work to be Done
===============

- Add 'amend' functionality which will pull information from a provided review-
  board request and amend the local commit to reflect "ship-its", review-board
  ids, and CAR ids.
- Add 'update' functionality which will perform the same local data-gathering as
  'upload', but will update an already-allocated review-board request, rather
  than create a new one.
- Expand the functionality of 'upload' and 'update' to allow for uploading any
  arbitrary number of commits.
- Harden the process of validating repositories on the RB server.
- Add the ability for the user to verify which RB server repository they
  intend to apply to, if it is not immediately obvious. (see the pick_repo
  function).
- Expand tool functionality to cover perforce changelists.
